# Try Catch Degree

## Project:
- TensorFlow UI

## Project Introduction
TensorFlow is a powerful and well-rounded machine learning system,
used by many different groups for an immense number of tasks around the globe.
With the advent of AI and ML becoming so commonplace,
it offers one of the most compelling entry points into such a world.
However, due to the code-driven nature of the framework,
it tends to be relatively unfriendly to new users.

To remedy this situation, a UI should be developed.
This UI should be intuitive and good-looking,
presenting a slick and effortless means of creating and training ML models for anybody with a basic understanding of the principles behind TensorFlow.
This UI is what we are developing.
It uses the idea of nodes as code segments, which can be linked together in a similar style to Scratch programs,
to visually illustrate a model being created.

Our aim with this project is to make ML more accessible,
and therefore allow the many benefits of machine learning to be used by more people,
through lowering the barrier to entry of writing and training a model.
