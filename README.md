# Try Catch Degree

## Project:
- TensorFlow UI

## Project Introduction
TensorFlow is a powerful and well-rounded machine learning system,
used by many different groups for an immense number of tasks around the globe.
With the advent of AI and ML becoming so commonplace,
it offers one of the most compelling entry points into such a world.
However, due to the code-driven nature of the framework,
it tends to be relatively unfriendly to new users.

To remedy this situation, a UI should be developed.
This UI should be intuitive and good-looking,
presenting a slick and effortless means of creating and training ML models for anybody with a basic understanding of the principles behind TensorFlow.
This UI is what we are developing.
It uses the idea of nodes as code segments, which can be linked together in a similar style to Scratch programs,
to visually illustrate a model being created.

Our aim with this project is to make ML more accessible,
and therefore allow the many benefits of machine learning to be used by more people,
through lowering the barrier to entry of writing and training a model.

Profile Description of each Member of Try Catch Degree:
-Felipe Jorge
I am always ready and eager to learn new topics and to increase my knowledge
about every aspect of Computer Science. Whenever I encounter something new or
unfamiliar, I’m extremely curious to find out how it works and how I can best use it to my
advantage in the future. Driven by this curiosity, I can say I have learnt everything the
Computer Science degree has offered so far and much more. I am eager to learn from this
project and the new experiences it offers.

-Wessel Kruger
I am a third-year student that is passionate about programming. Skills that I have
acquired during my three years studying Computer Sciences, includes programming in C++,
python, Java and C#. It also includes web-development, web-forms in C# and user
interfaces in C#. My part time job has given me experience in SQL and database
management as well. I am always willing to learn something new and to improve my current
programming skills.

-Siviwe Lechelele
I am a very ambitious and dedicated individual, who seeks to always go above and
beyond when it comes to completing a project. In my previous few years studying I believe
that I have acquired the skills necessary to tackle any reasonable problem given and do so
efficiently and effectively. My knowledge in java and other programming languages will be a
great advantage in completing this project.

-Werner van Rensburg
I’m a determined student software developer with a keen interest in learning and
gaining experience in new and different parts of technologies. I have some experience in
developing front end user interfaces and know I would be a great asset in developing an
interactive and intuitive user interface. I have a personal interest in the design and
development of the user experience. A reactive and intuitive interface that is aesthetically
pleasing will be of vital importance when developing a UI for this project.

-David Walker
As a third-year student myself, I come with all the associated knowledge of
programming and theory which is required at this academic level. Furthermore, as I am
participating in an AI module this year, the subject matter is one of huge interest to me, and
the idea of making a relatively abstract, maths-heavy concept available to the most people
and as accessible as possible sounds incredibly appealing. Specifically, I think that machine
learning is the way of the future, and that making it more accessible could lead to huge
breakthroughs in human technology and knowledge. To that end, I would personally love to
work on a project which makes it more accessible.
